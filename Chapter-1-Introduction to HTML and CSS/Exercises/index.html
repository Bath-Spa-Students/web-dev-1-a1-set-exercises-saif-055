      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Begin this roast chicken recipe by preheating the oven. Switch the
          oven to 180ºC/gas mark 4 and place a roasting tray in the oven
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Make the herb mix for the chicken. Mix the herbs with the cream
          cheese, butter and zest, season well with salt and pepper and reserve
          to one side
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          To prepare the chicken remove the parson’s nose and trim up any excess
          fat.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Loosen the skin from the breast by gently working your fingers over
          the meat and under the skin to make a pocket repeat on the other side.
          Stuff the herb mix evenly under both breasts
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          With a sharp knife, score the legs with two or three incisions, this
          will make the legs crispy and allow them to cook quicker. Tie up the
          legs of the chicken
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Rub olive oil over the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Take
          the hot roasting tray from the oven and place the chicken on its side
          with the thigh of the chicken pressed firmly down. Use the carrot to
          prevent the chicken breast falling onto the tray and balance the
          chicken
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Cook for 25 minutes before turning over and repeating for around 20
          minutes
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Sit the chicken upright for a further 15 minutes before removing.
          Check that the bird is cooked by inserting a small knife into the wing
          knuckle of the bird to test for blood. Allow to rest at room
          temperature for 10 minutes
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the lettuce and cream and bring back to the boil for 15 seconds
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Season to taste, reheat the peas and add to the sauce</li>
      </ol>
